# 1. [Password Checker App](misc_apps/password_checker.py)
Initially creating a pure-python version with `if-else` and list operations. Might branch off into one which works on checking regex in the user input.  

1. Password should be >= 8 characters
2. should contain atleast 1 digit 🔢
3. Should contains atleast 1 UPPER case letter ⬆️ 
4. Must contain atleast one special character 🔣

To be developed later into a streamlit app version to explore the latest changes of the platform.

# 2. [Area of a rectangle calculator]()
Routine area calculator of a rectangle that seems simple, but adding features for :
- Error-handling: Exploring various methods of addressing  scenarios where user input is invalid / non-numeric
- Plotting a rectangle that matches in proportion to the user input values.

To be created as a streamlit or gui application.
