# Password Checker App
Initially creating a pure-python version with `if-else` and list operations. Might branch off into one which works on checking regex in the user input.  

1. Password should be >= 8 characters
2. should contain atleast 1 digit 🔢
3. Should contains atleast 1 UPPER case letter ⬆️ 
4. Must contain atleast one special character 🔣

To be developed later into a streamlit app version to explore the latest changes of the platform.
