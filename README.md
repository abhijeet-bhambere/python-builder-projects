Welcome to the Python Builder Projects repository! ðŸš€ #learning_by_building

This repo is a growing stack of Python projects, each building on the last to reinforce core programming concepts and practical skills. From simple scripts to more advanced apps, every project is a step in my journey to master Python by building real solutions.

Each layer in this stack covers topics like data structures, file handling, control flow, and error management. The goal: learn by doing, and create a portfolio of working Python applications.

Explore the stack, review the code, and follow along as I progress from foundational exercises to more advanced solutions.
