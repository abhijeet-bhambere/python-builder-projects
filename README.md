# python-builder-projects
This repo contains building phase of my python journey #learning_by_building

The repo will contain several apps built as part of the 'builder' phase of my python journey 🛠️.


# List of apps:
## 1. **ToDo list:** 
But before that, starting with the basics (again 🙄)! <br>
Yet another basics grid but this one's important, especially since it works on some of the core data types in python:
  
    a. Lists operations
    
    b. File handling
    
    c. for, while loops ; try-except scenarios etc.

### Day 7: 
   Introducing File-handling with the  `with`, `open()`, `write()` funtions📄.
   
   This will enable a more stable storage space since earlier tasks would last only for the current instance of the script.

   Later on will move onto SQL or web-hosting, possibly a streamlit-to-SQL route 🛢️🔁🖥️.
