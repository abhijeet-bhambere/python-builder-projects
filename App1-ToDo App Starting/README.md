# Old Version - Uses `match-case`
This code is now archived in separate branch -- main branch will use `if-else` logic.

## App #1 - ToDo list:
Starting with the basics (I know,again)! Yet another basics grid but this one's important, especially since it helps revise on some of the core data types & their methods in python:
  
    a. Lists operations
    
    b. File handling
    
    c. for, while loops ; try-except scenarios etc.

### Day 1-7: 
Started with simple list iterations using `while`, `for` & `if-else` loops.

Then, introducing File-handling with the  `with`, `open()`, `write()` funtions📄. Worked on Add& Show functionalities.

This will enable a more stable storage space since earlier tasks would last only for the current instance of the script.

Later on will move onto SQL or web-hosting, possibly a streamlit-to-SQL route 🛢️🔁🖥️.

### Day 8-10
Extended logic of file handling to edit & 'mark as done' operations.
